      <h1>DATA of Value = DA + V = DAV</h1>

      <h2>How To Protect DAV & Increase their Value</h2>

      <p>A few years ago security and anti-virus software company McAfee did a survey to put a dollar value on digital assets. They found consumers in the U.S. valued their digital estate at $55,000, while globally these assets are valued at around $37,000.</p>

      <p>McAfee was making a point about security, stating that while consumers value these digital items they don’t often protect them properly.</p>

      <p>Here at the AB Lab, we see an even bigger issue: are these assets being factored into the current technology developments of access, privacy and ownership.</p>

      <h2>The Bits and Bytes That Create Data of Value (DAV)</h2>

      <p>Think of all the photos, files, videos, and personal info you have stored on your computer, smartphone, tablet, and in the cloud.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Personal Records</li>
        <li>Career Information</li>
        <li>Hobbies and Projects</li>
        <li>Personal Communications</li>
        <li>Entertainment Files</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Personal memories are valued at $7,000, well above purchased items because they’d be impossible to replace. While photos of a family vacation and other digital memories aren’t likely to fetch $7,000 on the open market, that’s what consumers felt they’re worth.</p>

      <h2>Why You Should Care About Your Data of Value(DAV)?</h2>

      <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551225471-e45c367f3b89?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&cs=tinysrgb&fm=jpg&crop=entropy" alt="Digital Data Visualization" />

      <p>Handing down photos from one generation to the next used to be as simple as handing over a few framed photos, some leather bound albums, and boxes of unsorted photos.</p>

      <p>Think of all the effort that used to go into taking photos. You had to buy film, conserve the number of exposures so you didn’t run out, get the roll of film developed (when you had time), sort the photos (when you had time), and then put them in an album.</p>

      <p>Now, you can immediately take a photo of anything and share it everywhere. It could be an adorable shot of your child frolicking in a field, a receipt for an expense report, or a funny looking french fry. People are taking thousands and thousands of photos. Some are posted on social media, but most are left unsorted and unnamed on phones and computers, backed up on hard drives, or stored in the cloud (Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud, Microsoft OneDrive, etc…) To help bring order to this digital disarray, consider these questions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>What do you want to happen to them?</li>
        <li>Would your spouse know how to access these photos if something happened to you?</li>
        <li>Do you want your grandkids sorting through an unmanageable amount of digital files on an antiquated hard drive searching for the best ones?</li>
        <li>Should these photos just disappear forever?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This is why digital assets are so important - data of value. Because these are our new memories. If you want them to be part of your legacy, something people remember you by long after you’re gone, you have to leave others a way to access and honor these personal treasures.</p>

      <h2>Enter, DAV - Data of Value</h2>

      <h2>DAV for you</h2>

      <p>Here’s the stuff you should care about and why they should care about it.</p>

      <h3>Devices</h3>
      <p><strong>DAV:</strong> Passwords to unlock devices.</p>
      <p><strong>Why You Share It:</strong> The devices used to access digital content -- computers, tablets, cell phones, eReaders, gaming systems -- have value. They can be handed down to someone else in the family or donated to charity. If you can’t unlock the device you will have no idea what you’re giving away. There could be a folder with tax returns and other sensitive info right on the desktop. If you can unlock the device you can download and delete whatever you choose and reformat the machine, either wiping it clean or setting it up for a new user.</p>

      <h3>Online Accounts</h3>
      <p><strong>DAV:</strong> If you use a password manager, share the master password. If you keep a document with your passwords, share that document.</p>
      <p><strong>Why You Share It:</strong> Think of all the different accounts and apps you access on a daily basis via password. Email, bill paying, shopping, social media, and so much more. What do you want to happen to all these accounts after you’re gone?</p>
      <p>When it comes to email, social media, and other accounts that have personal or professional correspondence and assets, what should your family or friends do with them? In the case of ongoing utilities and services set up to auto-pay (cable/internet, electricity/gas, home payments, streaming services), should these accounts be transferred to someone else? Should they be closed down and deleted?</p>
      <p>If you share the login info, it can be a seamless transition. The person handling your estate might still have to talk to some of these services on the phone or through email, but at least they’ll have all the info they need.</p>

      <h3>Digital Assets: Personal</h3>
      <p><strong>DAV:</strong> Location of photos/documents/projects and how to access them.</p>
      <p><strong>Why You Share It:</strong> These are the irreplaceable things that might not have monetary value on the open market, but are priceless to your family. Keep a list of hard drives or cloud-based online accounts somewhere handy so loved ones can access and either download the contents or transfer the account to themselves.</p>

      <h3>Digital Assets: Purchased</h3>
      <p><strong>What To Share:</strong> Movies, music, books, software, games, apps, and other things you purchased with the expectation of ownership.</p>
      <p><strong>Why You Share It:</strong> This is where things get tricky. If you bought a hardback book, you own that book and can give it to anyone with no strings attached. If you buy a digital book, you’re agreeing to terms and conditions that often state the book (or song, or movie, or game...) is to be used only by you during your lifetime.</p>
      <p>After you’re gone, and your account is closed, that item reverts back to the company that sold it to you.</p>
      <p>You might not think this is fair, especially if the price was equal (or even higher) to that of its physical counterpart. Unlike streaming services like Netflix, which is a per-month subscription without ownership, these are actual things you own, even though they’re only in digital form.</p>
      <p>Some companies may allow you to transfer these purchases to another account. At this moment in time, most won’t. So you have to gauge whether or not this is important to you.</p>
      <p>If you feel like you’ve gotten all the value you needed out of purchased digital items and they should revert back to the company that provided the service, then make that clear. If you purchased hundreds of songs or books and you don’t want your heirs to have to do the same, you may want that account to remain open in perpetuity and handed down to other generations.</p>
      <p>Of course, the companies providing the service might not approve, and you could be violating their terms of service, but think of it this way: Movie and music studios don’t routinely visit people’s homes and collect DVD/CD collections after a death.</p>

      <h2>Valuation Methods for DAV</h2>

      <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583320975624-d099f8c042f6?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&cs=tinysrgb&fm=jpg&crop=entropy" alt="Digital Asset Valuation" />

      <p><strong>Network Value Method:</strong> Value is determined using (1) the fundamental idea that the value of a network is derived from the people who use it and (2) Metcalfe’s Law in which a network’s value is proportional to the square of the number of its users.</p>
      <p><strong>Income Approach:</strong> For a digital asset with security-like features, value is based on discounting the cash flows associated with the digital asset over time.</p>
      <p><strong>Cost of Production Approach:</strong> The average variable cost of production provides a lower bound for the perceived value of the digital asset by rational miners. Where markets for mining cryptocurrencies are robust and reasonably competitive, the relative difficulty of mining such altcoins could also be considered as a possible indicator of their relative value.</p>
      <p><strong>Equation of Exchange:</strong> A macroeconomic model of a market in equilibrium (coin supply equals coin demand). The supply is the value of all coins in circulation times the velocity. Demand is the network “GDP.” Value is estimated based on the impact of an increase in coin supply on coin price; used where reliable velocity data is available, and can be used in a value-relative-to-comparables analysis.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      <p>Sound practices with respect to valuing digital assets or data is an emerging body of thought. Care should be taken in understanding the basis of value and using valuation techniques appropriate to basis and use of the valuation.</p>

      'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517336714731-489689fd1ca4?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1920&q=80',
    content: `<h1>How Apple's Contact Sharing Impacts the NFC Business Card Industry</h1>

    <p>Apple recently introduced a new contact sharing feature that allows iPhone and iPad users to seamlessly exchange digital contact information using ultra-wideband (UWB) signals. This proprietary solution offers frictionless networking between Apple devices without the need for extras like NFC-enabled business cards.</p>
    
    <h2>Could this development disrupt the fledgling NFC card industry?</h2>
    
    <p>Examining recent iPhone sales trends provides clues. In 2021, Apple sold over 206 million iPhones globally, with models like iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 making up the lion's share. Analysts estimate over 180-190 million of these devices were iPhone 11 and newer, with native support for contact sharing. iPhone sales are projected to keep rising, potentially hitting 250-300 million annually by 2025.</p>
    
    <p>For companies providing NFC business cards, this massive distribution of contact sharing-enabled iPhones poses an obvious threat.</p>
    
    <blockquote>Why would iPhone users pay extra for NFC cards when they can share contacts seamlessly out-of-the-box?</blockquote>
    
    <p>However, opportunities remain.</p>
    
    <p>Apple's solution only works between Apple devices, while NFC cards provide cross-platform functionality across both iOS and Android. For enterprises with mixed device environments, NFC cards remain compelling for scalable contact distribution and retrieval.</p>
    
    <p>NFC cards also enable additional digital features like links, analytics, lead tracking, and social media integration. For use cases around events, sales, and marketing, NFC cards provide greater versatility than Apple's contact sharing alone.</p>
    
    <p>According to estimates, global NFC card sales could still steadily grow from around 2-5 million units today to 10-30 million by 2025. Driving factors include rising NFC adoption in smartphones overall, expanding enterprise use cases, and consumer-focused applications.</p>
    
    <p>NFC business card providers should highlight cross-platform flexibility and advanced functionality when marketing to commercial users. Integrating NFC cards with Apple's contact sharing via AirDrop or similar is another potential opportunity.</p>
    
    <p>With innovative strategies, the NFC card market can continue thriving—even as Apple exerts its influence. The long-term trends still point to NFC becoming a ubiquitous networking technology across both mobile operating systems.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Points about the Projected Growth of the Smart Business Card with NFC Market:</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li>The global market for NFC-enabled smart business cards is still relatively small, estimated at around $50-100 million in 2022.</li>
      <li>However, it is forecast to grow at a CAGR of over 25% from 2022-2027 according to most analysts.</li>
      <li>Key growth factors include proliferation of NFC technology in smartphones, the need for contactless interactions post-pandemic, and innovative use cases in sales, marketing, and events.</li>
      <li>By 2027, some estimates project the market could reach $350-500 million in size.</li>
      <li>North America and Europe are currently the largest markets, but Asia Pacific is expected to see the fastest growth.</li>
      <li>Adoption remains limited by high costs compared to traditional cards, lack of infrastructure, and tech literacy challenges.</li>
      <li>As costs reduce with scale and designs improve, NFC cards could capture 5-10% of the overall business card market in the next 5 years.</li>
      <li>Leading players like Moo, BLK, Popl, and V1CE are introducing new pricing models and value-added digital features to drive mainstream uptake.</li>
      <li>Strategic partnerships between card suppliers, mobile OEMs, and digital identity platforms are also helping adoption.</li>
      <li>While still a niche segment, continued strong growth is projected for smart NFC-enabled business cards owing to mobile and digital transformation tailwinds.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>In summary,</strong> while starting from a small base, smart NFC business cards are estimated to grow 25%+ annually, passing the $500 million market size in the next 5 years as adoption accelerates across use cases.</p>
